# EasyMusic
Android music player (Course Project)
# Introduce
A simple music player on Android implemented mainly by MediaPlayer Api with Service.<br>
This app may not look pretty cause it's just a course project and my major work is implementing the logic...<br>
- use MediaPlayer API
- MVVM architecture (LiveData & ViewModel & RxJava)
- store music and history list by sqlite
- list manage: select, delete...
- multi play mode..
- choose audio track (experiment function)
